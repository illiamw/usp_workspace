# P3 ICC - Final Test

This program implements a simplified version of the Bullet Collision Detection of an FPS game.
Reading a character file (model) and calculating your bounding-box, the program returns if the character has been hit or not.

Four tests files are available for validation of the program.

The comments are in Portuguese due to the evaluative character of this test.
